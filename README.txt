methylCtools ..
 .. is a set of tools for the analysis of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data for studying DNA methylation [1].
 .. uses a similar alignment approach as bismark [2] (and others before), but improves on the handling of large amounts of data by providing enhanced speed, scalability and avoiding unnecessary I/O.
 
 .. builds upon the popular short-read aligner BWA [3], integrates well with the most of the common/popular tools of next-generation sequencing analysis. 
 .. implements a novel approach for the detection of SNVs within CpG/non-CpG sites that prevents erroneous methylation calling. check the bcall.py file for more details.

 .. does not provide a one-touch workflow, but requires the user to perform and understand the individual steps.
 .. has been designed for use on large server infrastructures.
 
 

INSTALL:

make sure pysam is working within python and make methylCtools executable.
methylCtools has been tested on linux and mac systems.

bwa 0.6     version tested: 0.6.1-r104          http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/                 [3] (version >0.6 required for human genome because of reference size limit in previous versions)

SYNOPSIS:

- performed once (generation of indexes):

1a)  methylCtools fapos reference.fa - | bgzip > reference.pos.gz
1b)  tabix -s 1 -b 2 -e 2 reference.pos.gz

2a)  methylCtools faconv reference.fa reference.conv.fa
2b)  bwa index -a bwtsw reference.conv.fa

- perfomed for every sample (processing of sequencing reads):

3)   methylCtools fqconv -1 reads1.fq -2 reads2.fq reads.conv.fq

4)   bwa mem -p -M reference.conv.fa reads.conv.fq | samtools view -Sb - > reads.conv.bam

5a)  methylCtools bconv reads.conv.bam - | samtools sort - reads
5b)  samtools index reads.bam

6a)  methylCtools bcall reference.pos.gz sample.bam - | bgzip > sample.call.gz
6b)  tabix -s 1 -b 2 -e 2 sample.call.gz



COMMENTS:

- all tools in methylCtools display help messages that explain different options and input/output files (--help).

- an overview of the different processing steps is provided in FLOWCHART.pdf

- most tools support reading from stdin and writing to stdout. simply define "-" instead of the filename.

- if bwa-mem is used (recommended), mark shorter split reads as secondary (-M) for methylCtools bconv compatibility.

- using pipes significantly speeds up processing time and reduces I/O. for example, steps 3 to 5a can be run in a single pipe (define both -1 and -2 in methylCtools fqconv to create an interleaved fastq file, then use -p in bwa mem, then samtools view, methylCtools bconv, and samtools sort). use mbuffer between tools to minimize waits.

- if you are planning to use picard (for example to remove PCR duplicates), make sure to have the entries in the original fasta file sorted alphabetically (e.g. chr1, chr10, chr11, ..., chrM, chrX, chrY).

- please do not hesitate to send comments, bug reports or feature requests.
